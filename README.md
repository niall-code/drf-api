To run a front-end (HTML/CSS/Javascript) application in Gitpod, in the terminal, type:

`python3 -m http.server`

To run a back-end Python file, type `python3 app.py` (if the Python file is named 'app').

Gitpod gives you superuser security privileges by default. Therefore, you do not need to use the `sudo` ("superuser do") command in the bash terminal.
